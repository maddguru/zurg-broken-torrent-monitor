## 🙏 Acknowledgments

This little project was inspired by yowmamasita [Zurg/DebridMediaManager](https://github.com/debridmediamanager/zurg-testing) and godver3 [cli_debrid](https://github.com/godver3/cli_debrid). These two creators have spent countless hours building reliable tools for the community, and I have a deep appreciation for their work. I am not even close to being a developer so I used my particular set of skills to instruct AI to bring this and a few other ideas to life. I had an idea of creating a simple, standalone backup solution, until this feature returns to Zurg. And here we are.
